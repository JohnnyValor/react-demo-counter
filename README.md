 After learning these concepts, I decided to create a counter application and was challenged to create one with the following:
 
        Increment and decrement buttons, with counter number showing.
        Add functionality counting the number of clicks made to BOTH increment and decrement buttons, with the number showing.
        Functionality that allows for an exact custom number to be entered, which also reset the clicks counter.
